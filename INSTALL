To install, follow these steps to build and install an RPM. These
steps assume a CentOS 5.7 or similar distribution, with git, gcc,
gcc-c++, make and rpm-build.

1. Clone the git repository to your local machine
2. Run `make rpm`
3. Install with the following, where <arch> represents your machine
   architecture:
   `rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch>/xen-crashdump-analyser-*.rpm`

The `make rpm` step generates a spec file from the spec.in and uses it
to build source and binary RPMs. The source RPMs are output to
/usr/src/redhat/SRPMS/ and the binary RPMs to
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch>/
