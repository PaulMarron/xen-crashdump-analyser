/**
 * @namespace Abstract
 *
 * Abstract Base Classes for components with different implementations
 * based on the compiled architecture of Xen.
 *
 * Every component will have an architecture specific implementation.
 * This allows common code to use arch specific code with an
 * architecture agnostic interface.
 *
 * There is some code in the namespace, for example the static function
 * Elf::create() which parses a single resource and chooses the correct
 * arch specific Elf class to instantiate.
